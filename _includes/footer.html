		<p> &copy; 2017 BY FIRST CHOICE CREDIT MANAGEMENT, LLC</p>
		<p><small>Our clients who make all their monthly program payments are expected to pay approximately 42% of their enrolled balance before fees, or 56% including fees, over 12 to 48 months. Not all of our clients are able to complete their program for various reasons, including their ability to set aside sufficient funds. Our estimates are based on industry averages, which will vary depending on your specific circumstances. We do not guarantee that your debts will be resolved for a specific amount or percentage or within a specific period of time. We do not assume your debts, make monthly payments to creditors or provide tax, bankruptcy, accounting or legal advice or credit repair services. Our service is not available in all states and fees may vary from state to state. Please contact a tax professional to discuss potential tax consequences of less than full balance debt resolution. Read and understand all program materials prior to enrollment. The use of debt settlement services will likely adversely affect your creditworthiness, may result in you being subject to collections or being sued by creditors or collectors and may increase the outstanding balances of your enrolled accounts due to the accrual of fees and interest. However, negotiated settlements we obtain on your behalf resolve the entire account, including all accrued fees and interest.</small></p>
